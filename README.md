# Prompt Iteration Playground

As a side note, all API keys are encrypted and stored in your browser's local storage, so you can use this project without having to worry about your API key being stolen.

## Demo

### Playground Environment
Use like how playground works, but for every sequential completion from Assistant you require, "Add message" to create a "Placeholder" for the completion. 

After first run, you can just click "Run" to run the same prompt again. No need to delete the text populated in "Assistant".

### Mock ChatGPT Environment (currently deprecated)
